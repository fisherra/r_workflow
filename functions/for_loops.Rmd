### basic for loop

```{r}
i <- 1 

for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```

### for loops for simple assignment


```{r}
i <- 1
ex <- vector('double', length = 10)

for (i in seq_along(ex)) {
  ex[i] = i
  i = i + 1
}

ex
```

#### for loops for complex assignment

you have a counter, a data vector, and an 'save' vector. for every element in the data vector, perform some function and save that output to your save vector. report results of save vector. 
```{r}
i <- 1
data <- 1:10
save <- vector('double', length = 10)

for (i in seq_along(data)) {
  save[i] = data[i] + mean(data)
  i = i + 1
}

save
```

Check out the purrr post for more efficient ways to do this, in some cases. Also be aware this is not vectorized, and thus not ideal in R.
