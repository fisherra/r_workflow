### Select

In a data frame with numerous variables it's easy become overwhelmed and broad with analysis. `select()` reduces the number of variables in a data frame, only keeping variables that the user inputs as arguments. In this example, flights are reduced from 19 variables to the variables year, month and day. 

```{r}
select(flights, year:day)
```
