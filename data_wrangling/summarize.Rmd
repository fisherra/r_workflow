#### Summarize


`summarize()` is perhaps the most complicated function in dplyr. Often used in conjunction with `group_by()`, `summarize()` collapses many values into a single summary. In the above example. `summarize()` finds the mean departure delay of all 336,776 observations in the flights dataset. As a result, the single value 12.64 (minutes) summarizes the mean departure delay. 

```{r}
summarize(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
