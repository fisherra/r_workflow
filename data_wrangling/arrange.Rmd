#### Arrange

Often observations within a data frame are ordered arbitrarily, or unproductively. `arrange()` reorders observations according to its user specified arguments. In this example, the flights data frame is called upon as the first argument once again; this is common syntax within dplyr functions and I won't be referencing it henceforth. The second argument is `desc(dep_time)`. `desc()` is one of the secondary functions listed previously; it simply transforms a vector into a format that will be sorted in descending order. `dep_time` is the flights variable departure time, a number from 0000 to 2400, indicating the actual departure time of an individual aircraft. The resulting data frame has all 336,776 observations sorted from latest (highest) to earliest (lowest) departure time. 


```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_time))
```
